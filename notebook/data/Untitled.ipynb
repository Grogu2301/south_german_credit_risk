    "\n",
    "Normally, most of the bank's wealth is obtained from providing credit loans so that a marketing bank must be able to reduce the risk of non-performing credit loans. The risk of providing loans can be minimized by studying patterns from existing lending data. One technique that you can use to solve this problem is to use data mining techniques. Data mining makes it possible to find hidden information from large data sets by way of classification.\n",
